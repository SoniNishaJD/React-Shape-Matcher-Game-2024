=================
1. public/ Folder
You don’t need to modify anything here. This folder contains the HTML file (public/index.html) where the React app will be injected.

2. src/ Folder
This is the folder where you will write most of your code.

Step 3: Modify and Create Files
1. src/index.js (No changes needed)
This file is the entry point for your React application, and it’s already set up. It mounts the root React component (App.js) to the DOM.
=====================
2. src/App.js (Main Game Logic)
This is the file where your main game logic will reside.
=====================
3. src/components/Shape.js (Shape Component)
Create a new folder named components inside the src folder. Inside the components folder, create a file named Shape.js. This file will handle the rendering of different shapes.
=================
4. src/App.css (Styling)
You can also style the game to make it visually appealing. Add this to the App.css file.
========================
npm start
==================
1. Shape Matching:
Two random shapes (circle, square, triangle) are displayed side by side.
The player must decide if the shapes are identical or different.
Players click either the "Match" button if they believe the shapes are the same, or the "No Match" button if they think they are different.
2. Scoring System:
The player earns 1 point for each correct answer.
The score is displayed at the top of the screen and updates in real-time after each round.
3. Time Limit:
The player has 30 seconds to score as many points as possible.
A countdown timer is displayed, indicating the time left for the game.
Once the time runs out, the game ends and displays the final score.
4. Game Over Screen:
When the time is up, the game shows a "Game Over" message along with the player's final score.
The player cannot continue to click after the game ends, and they will need to refresh the page to play again.
5. Shape Randomization:
After each round, the shapes are randomized. This ensures the game remains dynamic and engaging with different combinations of shapes in every round.
6. Simple and Intuitive UI:
The game uses a minimal design with clear and large buttons for easy gameplay.
Shapes are displayed in a large, visible format to ensure players can quickly make decisions.
Instructions and feedback (such as the score and time remaining) are displayed prominently on the screen.
7. Responsive Design:
The game is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes. Whether on a desktop or mobile, the layout remains functional and user-friendly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
